# Portfolio with Lyrics App

## About

This is a work-in-progress portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), featuring a **Lyrics Sharing App**. The Lyrics App is built using React and Material UI, allowing me to practice React development within Astro.

The portfolio serves as the landing page, introducing me and linking to the Lyrics App available at `/lyrics-app`.

In the future, the Lyrics App may be fully converted into Astro components or separated into another app for better performance and simplicity.

## Features

- Portfolio homepage with a clean, minimal design
- Lyrics App built with React and Material UI:
- Finding a song using Spotify Web API
- Fetching the lyrics from lrclib
- Generating a share-ready lyrics image with selected lyrics
- Downloading the image in high quality
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design
- Tailwind CSS used for styling the portfolio
